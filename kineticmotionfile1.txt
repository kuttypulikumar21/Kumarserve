I just wanted to touch base to see how you’re getting on with the control library we requested and the dynamic field groupings?

Keith showed you the groupings feature during the training:

Group 3 ->
                Group 3.1->
                … 

We need a neat way to represent grouped fields without using up too much space and will work on mobile phones.

From the UI document I think we asked for:

•	Textbox
•	Date picker
•	Colour picker
•	Grids
•	Loading spinners
•	Panels
•	Tabs
•	Split buttons
•	Modals
•	Loaders
•	Long press buttons (to open a menu for other actions)
•	And a split screen mode
